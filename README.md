# Defcon-Shoot-33-Badge
STLs of the defcon shoot 33 badge. The only supports you should need are for the bolt (printed upside down). Use a smooth plate for the bolt, the rest of the parts can use a textured plate.

Instructions: unscrew the bolts and insert the trigger (they weren't installed for shipping in the vegas heat in case the plastic trigger spring warped)  
Put the tictac container on top.  
Put a rubberband or two around the tictac container and between the trigger and upper receiver to hold the tictacs on.

Spring details:  
10mm outside diameter, 50mm long uncompressed. Originally I had 0.1mm coil diameter and ~11 turns (the spring almost completely compresses to catch the sear) but this was too strong and breaking some PETG bolts. So I went with 0.8 coil diameter 16 turns
